# **Learning Outcomes**

You should always keep the learning outcomes in mind when preparing for your exams,  
but do not let them restrict your curiosity or deeper understanding.

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>
        recall and use the following SI base quantities and their units: 
        mass (kg), length (m), time (s), electric current (A), temperature (K), 
        and amount of substance (mol).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>
        recall and use the following prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal
        sub-multiples or multiples of both base and derived units: pico (p), micro (µ),
        milli (m), centi (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), and tera (T).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>
        express derived units as products or quotients of SI base units, and use the
        named units listed in the “Summary of Key Quantities, Symbols and Units”
        as appropriate.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>
        use SI base units to check the homogeneity of physical equations.

    <tr>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>
        make reasonable estimates of physical quantities included within the syllabus.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>f</td>
      <td>
        show an understanding of the distinction between random errors and systematic
        errors (including zero error), and how these limit precision and accuracy.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>
        assess the uncertainty in derived quantities by adding absolute or relative
        (i.e. fractional or percentage) uncertainties, or by numerical substitution
        (rigorous statistical treatment is not required).
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>
        distinguish between scalar and vector quantities, and give examples of each.

    <tr>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>
        add and subtract coplanar vectors.
