# **1.2 Errors and Uncertainties**

In physics experiments, a measured quantity is written as $x \pm \Delta x$, where
$x$ is the measured value and $\Delta x$ shows how uncertain the measurement is.
This means that the true value is expected to lie somewhere within the range $(x-
\Delta x,\, x + \Delta x)$, rather than being exactly equal to $x$.{" "}

A single measurement
is limited because its uncertainty is mainly determined by the precision of the measuring
instrument and does not show how the result might change if the measurement were
repeated. Besides instrumental uncertainty, there may be other experimental uncertainties,
and these should be included in the stated value of $\Delta x$ when they are known.

## **1.2.1 Uncertainty due to Instrument**

Each **individual measuremnt** (**reading**) made using an instrusment carries an inherent uncertainty.
This instrumental uncertainty is taken as half of the smallest scale interval.

### **Fraction Uncertainty**

The **fractional unceratainty** is the ratio of the actual uncertainty to the measured value.

$$
\text{The fractional uncertainty in a quantity \( x \) is } \frac{\Delta x}{x}
$$

### **Percentage Uncertainty**

The percentage uncertainty is obtained by converting the fractional unceratainty into percentage
form by multiplying by 100%

$$
\text{The percentage unceratainty in a quantity \( x \) is } \frac{\Delta x}{x} \times 100\%
$$

## **1.2.2 SIgnificant Figures and Decimal Places**

1. **- Express uncertainties to 1 significant figure (1 s.f.)**
   > If the unceratainty in a measurement is estimated to be $ 0.025 $, it should be rounded to
   > $ 0.03 $
2. **- Express the quantity to the same palce value as its uncertainty.**

   > Using the same example, $ 0.03 $ has its most significant digit in the second decimal place.
   > Hence the quantity should be written to exactly two decimal places.

   > $ 12.10 \pm 0.03 $

   > and NOT $ 12.1 \pm 0.03 $ or $ 12.102 \pm 0.03 $

## **1.2.3 Combining Uncertainties**

### **(i) Adding or Subtracting Measured Quantities**

For \( c = a + b \), the absolute uncertainty in \( c \) is:

$$
\Delta c = \Delta a + \Delta b
$$

For \( d = a - b \), the absolute uncertainty in \( d \) is:

$$
\Delta d = \Delta a + \Delta b
$$

### **(ii) Multiplying or Dividing Measured Quantities**

For $p = ab$, the fractional uncertainty in $p$ is:

$$
\frac{\Delta p}{p} = \frac{\Delta a}{a} + \frac{\Delta b}{b}
$$

For $q = \frac{a}{b}$, the fractional uncertainty in $q$ is:

$$
\frac{\Delta q}{q} = \frac{\Delta a}{a} + \frac{\Delta b}{b}
$$

### **(iii) Scalling**

If $r = ka$, where $k$ is a constant, the absolute uncertainty in $r$ is:

$$
\Delta r = k(\Delta a)
$$

### **(iv) Power**

If $s = a^n$, where $n$ is a constant, the fractional uncertainty in $s$ is:

$$
\frac{\Delta s}{s} = |n| \frac{\Delta a}{a}
$$

### **(v) Special functions or complicated function, X**

The absolute uncertainty of $X$ is given by:

$$
\Delta X = \tfrac{1}{2} (\text{maximum possible } X - \text{minimum possible } X)
$$

That is,

$$
\Delta X = \tfrac{1}{2} (X_{\max} - X_{\min})
$$

## **1.2.4 Precision and Accuracy**

**Precision** is a measure of how well a result can be determined
(without reference to a theoretical or true value).
It is the degree of consistency and agreement among independent measurements of the same quantity.

**Accuracy** is the closeness of agreement between a measured value and a true or accepted value.

## **1.2.5 Systematic and Random Errors**

**Random Errors** are deviations of the measured value from the mean value, with varying signs and magnitudes.

Random errors can occur despite repeating the experiments under the same conditions.
Random errors are caused by environmental conditions, irregularity of wuantity being measured,
and limitations of the measurement equipment or the observer.

**To reduce random errors**

1. **- Improving the procedure to minimize uncertainty due to random errors**

For example, instead of measuring the thickness of a single sheet of paper, accuracy can be improved by stacking several sheets together and measuring the total thickness. Using the same micrometer screw gauge, the absolute uncertainty remains $\pm 0.01\ \text{mm}$, but since the measurement now corresponds to many sheets, the uncertainty in the thickness of one sheet of paper is reduced.

2. **- Using a large sample size in order for the mean value to be a good estimate of the true value**

<br />

**Systematic Errors** are deviations of the mean value from the true value, with
same sign and similar magnitude.
